# Rent or own calculator

Not much to say about this at this point. It has some old code I worked on about a year ago. I need to overhaul it and figure out how to design it properly before I say much more. Eventually the idea is for this to be a rent or own simulator. There are some good ones out there, but they're web based and require a lot of manual input if you want to try different scenarios, and they're pretty much all American, whereas I want one in a Canadian context
